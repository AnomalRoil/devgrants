# Open Grants

## About
Open grants are for novel ideas that advance the IPFS ecosystem, bring significant new usage, or directly [advance the IPFS mission statemnent](https://github.com/ipfs/roadmap#ipfs-mission-statement).

If your project is smaller in scope and less well-defined, you may want to consider [the microgrant program](../MICROGRANTS.md) instead.

## üìã How to apply
                                    
To submit an Open Grant proposal, [create a new issue](https://github.com/ipfs/devgrants/issues/new?assignees=realChainLife&labels=Open+Grant&template=open-grant.md&title=) using the Open Grants Proposal template. Please cover the project being proposed (including value to the IPFS ecosystem, deliverables, development, roadmap, and budget), and the team making the proposal (including your expertise and past work).
                                                                                                                    
Draft submissions are welcome and encouraged to gauge community interest and begin discussion, even if you are uncertain of the suitability of your proposal.

Open Grant proposals are reviewed monthly.

## ‚åõ After you apply

After you submit your proposal, you can expect the following to occur:

- We will review your application. During review, we will add comments, questions, change requests, et cetera on your team's submission.
- After a few round trips of discussion, our team will make a decision on which proposals to fund and which not to. <!--Accepted proposals will be merged into the appropriate directory, i.e. either [`open-grant`](https://github.com/filecoin-project/devgrants/tree/master/open-grant) or [`rfp-proposals`](https://github.com/filecoin-project/devgrants/tree/master/rfp-proposals).-->
- During the discussion and review phase, we will contact your team for financial and legal follow-ups, such as to confirm milestones and funding, your team's legal structure, etc.
- If your team is accepted, we will ask you to sign our Open Source Software Grant Agreement, which will include a copy of the work plan and funding milestones. 
- We aim to complete all review within a few weeks after the wave deadline, so please stay vigilant on GitHub.

Please reach out #grants-questions on Filecoin Slack ([invite](http://filecoin.io/slack)) or email grants@filecoin.org with any questions.
