# Project Description

4EVERLAND is a Web 3.0 cloud computing platform that integrates storage, computing, and network core capabilities. 
It aims to help the user make a smooth leap from Web 2.0 to Web 3.0 and become the infrastructure for millions of Web 3.0 developers and applications.

4EVERLAND has now launched Gateway Service, Hosting Service, Bucket Service, Gateway service to provide decentralized storage capacity and global acceleration gateway for developers and projects.

## Value

**- 4EVERLAND IPFS Gateway Service& Gateway Explorer** 
4EVERLAND Gateway is dedicated to making various Web3 protocols and blockchain networks compatible with Web2, as well as delivering high-performance and high-availability network service capabilities.

**- Hosting Service: Hosting Webs or Dapps on IPFS**
Users can quickly deploy websites to IPFS through a Github authorization or a Cli local build via 4EVERLAND Hosting service.

**- Bucket Service: Store file on IPFS** 
Bucket is an AWS S3 compatible storage platform for decentralized storage.

**- A truly decentralized IPFS storage layer** 
4EVERLAND has established IPFS swarm nodes based on the PoSC consensus mechanism. 
The master node will be responsible for backing up all the data stored in IPFS via 4EVERLAND, while the light node will partially back up the data and collaborate with 4EVERLAND's gateway nodes to enhance the availability of the network.
All nodes will be verified and disciplined in a TEE environment. 

**- A Web3 User System**
4EVERLAND supports wallet login.
This will allow us to integrate more easily with Web3 applications and create more usage and operation ways based on Web3 user identity.

## Deliverables

- Support multi-chain login and payment: users can login to Bucket using various public chain wallets such as ETH, Polygon and Solana, purchase and use IPFS storage space with any assets.
- Interactive user experience: provide users with a smooth experience of pinning data in IPFS, offering a variety of interaction methods including CLI, GUI, SDK, etc.
- Complete the construction of distributed IPFS nodes: complete the construction of IPFS storage nodes based on PoSC consensus, provide stable and highly available data storage services, and implement work including sentinel procedures, reward and punishment mechanisms, and campaign mechanisms.
